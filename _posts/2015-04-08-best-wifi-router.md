Looking to upgrade my house wifi after many years living on the [Linksys WRT54GL](http://www.amazon.com/Linksys-WRT54GL-Wireless-G-Broadband-Router/dp/B000BTL0OA/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1428546410&sr=1-1&keywords=WRT54GL).
About to take a look at this modest multi-antenna beast - The [TP-Link Archer C7](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BUSDVBQ?tag=thewire06-20&linkCode=as2&creative=374929&camp=211189)

I'll have to update with a review once I have it setup
