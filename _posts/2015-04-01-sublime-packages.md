## Couple notes

Sublime package installer is awesome! so definitely install that even if these packages aren't for you

Packages List

| Package | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| MarkDown Editing | pretty good.  gives an alternative syntax and theming.  Also has individual settings for standard, GFM and multimarkdown settings. |
| Jekyll | adds a few themes and syntax handling for markdown. Adds some useful Ctrl-Shift-P shortcuts to create posts, drafts. |
| GitGutter | lets you see diff markings in the margin against (by default) git HEAD.  Rather useful |
